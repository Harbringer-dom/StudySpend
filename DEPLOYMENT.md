## Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
- Check requirements.txt has correct versions
- Check Procfile syntax (no extra spaces)

**Database errors?**
- Render creates fresh database on deploy
- No need to include database.db in git

**Port issues?**
- Render automatically assigns port
- Don't hardcode port in app.py
